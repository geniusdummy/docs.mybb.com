There are multiple ways you can make your Forums the way you want it to be. You can make private forums where only staff can
see, where users can only see their own threads and much more.

## Forums where users can only see their own threads
If you want to make a support forum where users can only see their own threads (and where administrators and moderators 
can see them as well) go to your admin panel and the forum where you want to apply these changes to and go to permissions.

On Registered members click set custom permissions and check "users can view this forum" "users can see threads within the forum"
and "Users can only see their own threads", And everything under the posting tab.
